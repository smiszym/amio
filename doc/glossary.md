## Glossary

The convention is followed throughout the package sources that a "sample" means
a single-channel audio sample, while "frame" means a possibly-multichannel
set of samples at a given point in time. Hence "frame rate" is used to mean
the frequency at which frames are produced or consumed. For instance, the CD
quality is: frame rate of 44100 Hz, 2 channels, 16-bit samples.
